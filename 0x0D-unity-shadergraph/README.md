<p><strong>In this project we'll be having an introduction to shaders in Unity. We'll be using a shader's tool developed by Unity called ShaderGraph. We will create different types of effects combining materials, textures and shaders. Feel free to dive in the repo and see how they are made. Have fun!</strong></p>

<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Daniel Baquero. I'm a software engineer currently doing a specialization in Augmented and Virtual Reality, two types of tech which I'm very passionate about. I'm open to learn new things everyday and I never back down from a challenge. I consider myself organized, not only in my coding style but in my personal life. I like to work with other people and overcome difficulties as a team, this is because I enjoy learning from them as well as helping them out as much as I can. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-alejandro-baquero-arias-106a45195/">LinkedIn</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielB30589105">Twitter - </a><a href="https://github.com/DanielBaquero28/RacingTourApp">Portafolio Project</a></p>
